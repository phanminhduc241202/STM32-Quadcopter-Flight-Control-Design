# STM32-Quadcopter-Flight-Control-Design

**Introduction**

Building your own drone flight controller using an STM32 microcontroller is an exciting project that combines embedded programming, sensor interfacing, real-time processing, and control theory. This guide will walk you through the fundamental concepts and implementation details required to create a basic drone flight controller using STM32 microcontrollers.

Drones (or quadcopters) require precise control of multiple motors to maintain stability in the air. The STM32 family of microcontrollers, with their powerful processing capabilities, timers, and peripheral interfaces, make them ideal candidates for drone control applications.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:

- The basic principles of drone flight dynamics
- How to interface with sensors required for flight control
- How to implement a PID control loop for stability
- How to generate PWM signals to control motors
- How to build a complete basic drone flight controller

**Prerequisites**

Before starting this project, you should be familiar with:

- Basic STM32 programming
- Using STM32CubeIDE or similar development environments
- I2C and SPI communication protocols
- Basic understanding of control systems (helpful but not required)

**Hardware Requirements**

To follow along with this project, you'll need:

- An STM32 development board (F4 or F7 series recommended for performance)
- MPU6050 or similar IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Brushless motors and ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)
- A battery (LiPo battery, typically 3S or 4S)
- A drone frame
- Radio receiver (for remote control)

**Understanding Drone Flight Dynamics**

Before diving into the code, let's understand how a drone flies and the control principles involved.

**Coordinate System**

Drones operate with three axes of rotation:

- **Roll** (rotation around X-axis) - tilting left or right
- **Pitch** (rotation around Y-axis) - tilting forward or backward
- **Yaw** (rotation around Z-axis) - rotating clockwise or counterclockwise

**Motor Configuration**

In a quadcopter (the most common drone configuration), the four motors work together to control the drone's movement:

- Increasing all motor speeds makes the drone ascend
- Decreasing all motor speeds makes the drone descend
- Differential control of motor pairs creates roll, pitch, and yaw movements
